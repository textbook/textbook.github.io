Title: About

This website is proudly powered by [Pelican][1], which takes great advantage
of [Python][2]. It's hosted on [GitHub Pages][3]. The theme is a custom job
based on [Bulma][4], a flexbox-based CSS framework.

The icons are from [Font Awesome][5] by Dave Gandy. The pure HTML/CSS "Fork me
on GitHub" ribbon is based on [`github-fork-ribbon-css`][6] by Simon Whitaker; I
modified it to be flatter.
