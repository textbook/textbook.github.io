Title: (Not) Much Ado About Nothing

Summary: Why did I start this blog, again?

My last post to this blog was on the 15th of August, which `datetime` has just
informed me is exactly 14 weeks ago:

```
:::python
>>> import datetime
>>> datetime.date.today() - datetime.date(2015, 8, 15)
datetime.timedelta(98)
>>> 98 / 7.0
14.0
```

You might assume, therefore, that nothing of note has happened in those weeks,
but that would not be accurate. The day before writing the post, I'd been to the
first part of the interview process for [Pivotal Labs][pivotal] in London, as
an eventual result of which I'm sat here between leaving TRL and starting my new
job as a Senior Software Engineer.

Frankly, I'm rarely sure what to write *about*. I've written a couple of posts
on the process of building this blog, which was an interesting process in
itself (to me, at least), but now that it's stable what do I go on to write on
it?

So, in an attempt to kick myself into doing it, here are plans for a couple of
future posts that I'll try to write over the next few weeks:

 - Gig review (Tom Williams at London Fields Brewery, 2015/11/18);
 - What Pivotal's hiring process was like;
 - Why I'm excited to be starting at Pivotal (hopefully *before* starting); and
 - What starting at Pivotal was actually like (inevitably *after* starting).

Perhaps living in London during the week will provide more interesting fodder
for this than living in Bracknell has, but we'll see!
